Abstract: We study the label shift problem between the source and target domains in general domain adaptation (DA) settings. We consider transformations transporting
the target to source domains, which enable us to align the source and target examples. Through those transformations, we define the label shift between two
domains via optimal transport and develop theory to investigate the properties of
DA under various DA settings (e.g., closed-set, partial-set, open-set, and universal
settings). Inspired from the developed theory, we propose Label and Data Shift
Reduction via Optimal Transport (LDROT) which can mitigate the data and label
shifts simultaneously. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments to verify
our theoretical findings and compare LDROT with state-of-the-art baselines.
