Abstract: We study the entropic Gromov-Wasserstein and its unbalanced version between (unbalanced)
Gaussian distributions with different dimensions. When the metric is the inner product, which
we refer to as inner product Gromov-Wasserstein (IGW), we demonstrate that the optimal
transportation plans of entropic IGW and its unbalanced variant are (unbalanced) Gaussian
distributions. Via an application of von Neumannâ€™s trace inequality, we obtain closed-form
expressions for the entropic IGW between these Gaussian distributions. Finally, we consider an
entropic inner product Gromov-Wasserstein barycenter of multiple Gaussian distributions. We
prove that the barycenter is Gaussian distribution when the entropic regularization parameter
is small. We further derive closed-form expressions for the covariance matrix of the barycenter.
