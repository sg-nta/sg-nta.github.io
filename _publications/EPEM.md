Abstract: The problem of monotone missing data has been broadly studied during the last two decades and has
many applications in different fields such as bioinformatics or statistics. Commonly used imputation
techniques require multiple iterations through the data before yielding convergence. Moreover, those
approaches may introduce extra noises and biases to the subsequent modeling. In this work, we derive
exact formulas and propose a novel algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs)
of a multiple class, monotone missing dataset when all the covariance matrices of all categories are
assumed to be equal, namely EPEM. We then illustrate an application of our proposed methods in
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). As the computation is exact, our EPEM algorithm does not
require multiple iterations through the data as other imputation approaches, thus promising to handle
much less time-consuming than other methods. This effectiveness was validated by empirical results
when EPEM reduced the error rates significantly and required a short computation time compared to
several imputation-based approaches. We also release all codes and data of our experiments in one
GitHub repository to contribute to the research community related to this problem.
